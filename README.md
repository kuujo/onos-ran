# onos-ran
RAN subsystem for ONOS (ÂµONOS Architecture)

Presently, this is just a skeletal project established to provide support for the upcoming MWC demonstration.
However, we expected to start evolving quickly towards the long-term architecture.

## Running (provisionally)
To run `onos-ran`, use the following options:

```
> onos-ran --simulator <ip-address:port>
```
